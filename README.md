Case study on crypto exchange giant Coinbase

## Overview and Origin

Coinbase is one of the leading world’s crypto exchange platforms and the first crypto exchange platform operating in the United States. It allows its customers to trade digital currencies as well as transfer and store them. Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsham established the company in 2012 with the idea to enhance economic freedom of the world. Designed with beginners in mind, it opened the doors for millions of new users into the challenging and yet exciting world of crypto. Coinbase is known for its intuitive user-friendly interface and high level of security. Additionally, the company’s Web site is a helpful resource for new users to learn about crypto currencies and blockchain. 
 
Since its inception, Coinbase has gone through exponential growth. On early stage, the emerging tech-company was funded by Y Combinator for the amount of $150,000. A year after that, a promising startup received $5 million Series A investment from Union Square Ventures investor, Fred Wilson. In just a few months after that, Coinbase received $25 million funding from Ribbit Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square ventures. In 2015, Draper Fisher Jurveston funded the company with $75, which led to creation of Coinbase Pro, the company’s division for more upscale trading. In April 2021, Coinbase went public under the COIN ticker becoming the first crypto exchange company in the history of Nasdaq. As of beginning of 2021, the tech giant obtained 56+ million users gaining over $700 millions in profits with the revenue of $1,8 billion.  

## Business Activities

Coinbase’s global mission is to grow cryptoeconomy in order to enhance economic freedom. In his 2019 open house speech, Brian Armstrong outlined the steps to reaching this goal. These steps included acquiring and storing crypto, earning and using crypto, and starting new companies with crypto.
For cryptoeconomy to develop and flourish, it needs more individuals and businesses to get involved. Coinbase’s objective is to obtain as many new users as possible. One of the Coinbase’s competitive advantage is a strong well-known brand. Potential new users are likely to join the well-known secure network rather than exploring something less familiar. Besides individual users, Coinbase is targeting professional traders and institutions to secure larger trading volumes. The company is a popular choice for other companies to serve them as custodian (Tesla is among the largest clients).

Furthermore Coinbase is looking to venture out to create new applications and services (currently, they operate three applications: Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Wallet). In a meantime, the company is using other platforms to combine forces. For example, assets from Coinbase Wallet can be transferred to Compound Governance where users can accumulate compound interest on their investments. One of Coinbase’s well accepted marketing strategy is incorporating Earn campaigns, where new users can earn crypto currencies by learning about them. Finally, the company is acquiring smaller successful businesses to its benefit. A resent acquire is Bison Trails, an icloud platform, that is now used within Coinbase network, Counbase Cloud, to perform crypto transactions. 

## Landscape

Computing technology has gone long ways from being a one giant room-sized computer to pocket size devices. Original machines were highly centralized. Once the World Wide Web emerged, it used strictly client-server model. Moving towards globalization that model could no longer be capable of supporting big data flow. Data, on the other hand, had to be compressed into compact blocks so it could be easily transferred. Thus the concept of blockchain emerged. While there were many attempts to implement blockchain, Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin was the first successful one. Bitcoin’s price grew in parallel with its popularity, inspiring tech enthusiast to add their input in commerce. This way, crypto exchange platforms started to emerge. The largest first generation crypto exchange platform Mt. Gox turned out to have tremendous security issues and was forced to close. Later, new players in the field, such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and others, replaced it.

Today blockchain plays essential role in decentralization. What first used to be solely a crypto currency, evolved into a more complex technology. The most prominent example of such is Etherium. More and more companies jump onto blockchain train and create their own platforms and tokens that can be stored as “crypto stocks,” or exchanged to FIAT. 

## Results

Thanks to Coinbase, thousands of users join Crypto space of daily basis. Despite the fact that crypto environment is known to be intimidating and confusing for a newcomer, Coinbase is doing excellent job educating new non tech-savvy users in a fun engaging manner. Today, Coinbase has 56 million users, $335 billion quarterly volume traded, $223 billion assets on platform, over 1700 employees, and it operates in over 100 countries. These statistics make Coinbase number one platform in terms of volume and usage.

While Coinbase has a lot to offer to newcomers, there are some downsides that make potential new users search for other exchange platforms. One of the major minuses of Coinbase is its high transaction fees. That’s where the main competitors such as Binance and Kraken come into play. While Coinbase charges $2.99 for $100 spent, Binance charges 0.10% for that amount and Kraken fees are 0% to 0.26% per trade. Another downside is a limited variety of crypto offered. As of today, Coinbase offers 60 cryptos for trade while Binance offers 150, and Kraken offers slightly over 300. 

## Recommendations

Coinbase has established itself as one of the major players on the market. Even though the company is getting near the trillion dollars in revenue, it still has room to grow. Coinbase is already working to offer a Visa debit card to its customers that would come with points and perks. I would suggest they should consider adding a credit card as well.

Given the size of the company and growing number of the new players on arena, my recommendation to Coinbase would be to compress its transaction fees and to add more crypto currencies to trade. Finally, one thing I personally would be excited about is if they added compounding system, so that the stored assets could accumulate APR.
